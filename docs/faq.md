# F&Q

>Do I need an account to place an order?

No, you may place an order as a guest as well. However, there are advantages to having an account with us:

>Rapid checkout procedure

View your order status and order history with ease.
Receive notifications outlining our latest products and special discounts

>What types of payment do you accept?

We accept all major credit cards (VISA, Mastercard, Discover, AMEX).

>How safe is my online purchase?

When using a credit card to make an online purchase, all of your information is put into an SSL-secured web page. Your data is then SSL-encrypted and transmitted straight to the network of our credit card provider, where your card and transaction are validated and accepted. We do not keep your credit card details on our systems.

>What are the exchange rates?

Our entire business is conducted in US dollars. If your credit card is denominated in a different currency, your order total will be computed based on the exchange rate in effect on the date your card issuer executes the transaction.

>How can I configure my shipping address?

Since our website and service are based on the English language, you must use the English entry method for all information, including punctuation. If certain letters in your address contain non-English letters, it is recommended that you use the equivalent English letters. For instance, you may replace the character “?” with “c.”

>Can I modify my mailing address after submitting an order?

Please be informed that after your item has been completed and dispatched, your mailing address cannot be changed. As we do not know how long the destination’s customs agency would keep the box, please adjust your shipping address to your permanent residence instead of your vacation home.

>How long does delivery take, and how can I monitor my package?

The delivery time depends on the shipping method you’ve selected. As soon as the order ships. In most situations, the initial phase of cargo ships will last between four and six weeks. And the delivery service will not provide you the tracking number until the package arrives at the warehouse. We are not responsible for delays imposed by your country’s customs authority.

>What Should I Do If My Order Is Missing Items?
