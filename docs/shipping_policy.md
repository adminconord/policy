# SHIPPING POLICY

The processing of your purchase will occur within three business days.

Once the order has been finalized, you will receive an email notifying you of shipment.

To give the highest quality items at the lowest possible cost. We utilize the cargo ship for the initial phase of delivery.

Once the package arrives in a nearby warehouse, the delivery firm will provide you with a tracking number and take care of your package from there.

Typically, the cargo ship takes between four and six weeks to travel from our warehouse to your countryâ€™s warehouse. Please be aware that the tracking number will not be provided until the cargo ship has arrived.

Otherwise, air shipment would be too expensive; this is the most cost-effective option we can provide with free shipping.
All of the packages will be insured. On qualified orders, you are protected against package damage, loss, and theft regardless of what transpires during shipment or delivery. Save time and money while replacing the item.

In the event that a shipment must be replaced, you can recover the value of the original damaged/lost/stolen item.

To expedite the process, submit your claims directly from our customer service administrator (which takes only a few minutes).
